    <h1>My Side Projects</h1>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I selfhost a <a href="https://www.hewlett-packard-lovecraft.tk/writing">Writing instance</a>. Writing is a minmal FOSS web-based markdown and LaTeX by Joseph Ernest.
    </p>

    <h3>My Collection of CC/GNU FDL eBooks</h3>
    <p>I happen to have a <a href="https://www.hewlett-packard-lovecraft.tk/textbooks">sizable collection</a> of mostly Linux related books. I didn't create any of them, I just host them.
    </p>

    <h3>The Park</h3>
    <p>As an exercise in HTML, I turned an old story I wrote into a interactive game. It's still in development, so there's only a single ending so far. You can play it
    <a href="https://www.hewlett-packard-lovecraft.tk/story/startpage.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>SSH Heatmap</h3>
    <p>I used meesaltena' <a href="https://github.com/meesaltena/SSHHeatmap">SSHHeatmap script</a>
       to make an SSH heatmap of failed login attempts. It refreshes every hour. I've moved on to public key authentication and disabled password log in so it's empty
       right now, but I don't feel like taking it down just yet. You can take a look <a href="https://www.hewlett-packard-lovecraft.tk/heatmap.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Discord Bot</h3>
    <p>I've written a Discord music bot using the Javacord3 library. I'm sorry it's not FOSS, I need to keep the token a secret. </p>

    <h3>webserver-heatmap</h3>
    <p>I'm working on a webapp using React and Leaflet.JS to map unique requests to a webserver. It only supports Apache, but I plan on supporting nginx further on. You can visit the github repo <a href="">here</a>. </p>

    <h3>Webserver Dashboard</h3>
    <p>Simple webserver dashboard.</p>
