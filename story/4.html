    The facility he had found himself in was an old theme park, named after an old film no one alive could 
remember. _The Day of The Dead_, it was called. It featured skull-themed rides, and a massive skull-themed

could comprehend in one place. Now, it was a shadow of it's former self, visited only occasionally through 
the centuries by those like him.

Package was wrapped tightly in itâ€™s odd packages. He jumped up and down. He thought of what he may have done
wrong. He blamed it on nerves.
