    Wanderer dragged his walking stick along the fine layer of sand that had managed to break through the 
massive doors and the oddly metallic gates in front of them. The sound of his sandals echoed along the ancient
halls. Sand, as far as Wanderer’s cataract-infused eyes could see, covered chairs, tables, counters, and doors. 
He sat down, and washed the bitter sensation of dehydration from his mouth.

    The theme park’s network of cameras registered movement in the cafeteria. Through it’s cold and unfeeling 
metal eyes, the park watched it’s first visitor in decades. The intruder had entered the park, bypassed the 
metal detectors, and had crossed into the cafeteria. Another message was sent along the nonexistent phone 
lines to the police station that no longer served a purpose, this time with a much more urgent message.

    Wanderer sat on a bench, and put aside his belongings. He put aside his remaining coins, that is, those 
that he had not bartered away or had been taken from him. He carefully counted them before carefully placing them 
in a safe place. He counted his remaining supplies: Some tinned food, his canteens, his prized map, and, of course, 
the silvery-blue container he was tasked with transporting. What was it? He didn't know. Why did whoever was at 
the opposite end of the storm need it? He didn't know, and as far has he was concerned, he didn't need to.
