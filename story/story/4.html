    The facility he had found himself in was an old theme park, named after an old film no one alive could 
remember. _The Day of The Dead_, it was called. It featured skull-themed rides, and a massive skull-themed

could comprehend in one place. Now, it was a shadow of it's former self, visited only occasionally through 
the centuries by those like him.

wrong. Very wrong. He stood up. The storm cleared. He had his map. He had his cans. He had his canteen. The
Package was wrapped tightly in itâ€™s odd packages. He jumped up and down. He thought of what he may have done
wrong.
