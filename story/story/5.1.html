      Wanderer opened his cans with a small knife he always carried around with
      him. It took some time, but managed not to cut himself. He levered open
      the can and found that sand had breached the seal. The foul smelling pool
      of liquid and the salmon lump was familiar to him. It was caked with sand,
      and most of it was completely inedible. He needed to get to the other
      side, fast.
