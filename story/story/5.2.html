    Wanderer packed up his things, and shoved them into his rucksack. He wasâ€™t hungry, anyway. He walked outside 
to a puzzling sight. The ever-present dust disappeared, and many structures that seemed to serve no purpose was
visible. Metal snakes, twisting and turning in the air. Watchtowers, placed in odd locations on guard against no
perceivable enemy, with tubes snaking out of them. Tall walls that guard against what? What looked like ship, on 
land. Massive obviously structurally-unsafe structures dotted the landscape.
