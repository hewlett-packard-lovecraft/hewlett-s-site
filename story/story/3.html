    Wanderer was a courier. He helped deliver parcels from one end of the storm to the other. It explained his 
cataracts, his graying hair, and his blistering skin. Unbeknownst to him, he was forty-six, but looked like 
an old man to the single functioning camera inside the building.

    Wanderer ate his fill, and fell asleep on a bench shortly after inventorying the contents of his rucksack. 
He had wrapped his ancient lead-lined coat around him as he slept. Why did he wear it? He didn't know. He 
considered it good luck. It was the sole reason he had survived so long living the life he lead. He was one 
of the more famous couriers, for he managed to survive thirty years delivering packages. However, business 
was decreasing. The cities on the east and west gradually became more and more self-sufficient, and no one 
wanted packages delivered anymore.
